# Grid Based Level Editor
Grid based level editor project in which you can select, position, rotate objects in levels. Save, load and test them easily and quickly.

## How to use it?

This tool includes many features.

In the left panel, objects can be selected along with their materials. When the selected objects are placed on the grid, they smoothly transition into position. Objects can be stacked on top of each other. Desired objects can be rotated using the mouse wheel. To delete an object, simply hover over it and press the delete key. Every stack of objects placed on the grid is saved.

You can navigate within the editor using the arrow keys. The zoom in and zoom out buttons in the bottom right adjust the distance to the objects.

In the top right, the leftmost button is the trash button, which allows all objects in the level to be deleted at once. Next to it is the level button, which lets you create new levels and quickly switch between them. The play button on the far right allows you to instantly test the created level. While in the test scene, you can press the E key to return to the level editor.

After creating the desired levels, all that's left is to create copies of the current scene equal to the number of levels, name them appropriately, and add them to the Scenes in Build panel.

With this tool, I aimed to speed up the level design process.

## About the game

The game is about frogs collecting berries with their tongue. Frog throws its tongue when clicked, tongue moves straight forward. If any arrow with same color is hit by the tongue, tongue continues to move towards the direction arrow looks at. If tongue hits a object in with a different color, it stops moving and returns back without collecting any berry. When all berries are collected, game finishes.
